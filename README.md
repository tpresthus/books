# Reading list
The following page lists a couple of books I recommend to aspiring software craftsmen. They're not sorted in any particular order, but I try to categorize them by the level of experience required to get a good ROI off reading them.

## Starting your journey

These books are aimed at developers who are not very familiar with software craftmanship. They describe ideas and tactical approaches to writing better software.

 -  **Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship** by Robert C. Martin (ISBN 978-0132350884)
 -  **Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code** by Martin Fowler (ISBN 978-0201485677)
 -  **Growing Object-Oriented Software, Guided by Tests** by Steve Freeman and Nat Pryce (ISBN 978-0321503626)
 
## Modelling

When you've accomplished a certain grasp of craftmanship, you might start to think about software development from another perspective. You're certainly not alone in this. Eric Evans wrote the book "Domain-driven Design: Tackling complexity in the heart of software" back in 2003. For me this was a real eye-opener, as it highlights the problems caused by the industry-standard approach to developing software: I.e. development and business being two different things. The truth is that software is valuable to the business, and should help the business in adding more value. This can be achived using a plethora of tactics and strategies.

 -  **Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software** by Eric Evans (ISBN 978-0321125217)
 -  **Applying Domain-Driven Design and Patterns: With Examples in C# and .NET** by Jimmy Nilsson (ISBN 978-0321268204)
 -  **Implementing Domain-Driven Design** by Vaughn Vernon (ISBN 860-1404568893)
